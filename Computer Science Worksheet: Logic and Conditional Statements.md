## Part 1: Truth Tables
__AND__ Operation (&&) Complete the truth table for the AND operation:

| AND | | |
| --- | --- | --- |
| A	 | B	| A && B |
|true |	true	|
|true |	false	|
|false |	true |	
|false |	false	|

__OR__ Operation (||) Complete the truth table for the OR operation:
| OR | | |
| --- | --- | ------ |
| A	 | B	|   A \|\| B  |
| true | true | |
| true | false | | 
| false | true | |
| false | false | |

## Part 2: If Statements
1. Basic If Statement Write an if statement that prints “Pass” if the variable score is greater than or equal to 50.
``` _


```

1. If-Else Statement Write an if-else statement that prints “Pass” if the variable score is greater than or equal to 50, and “Fail” otherwise.

``` _


```


## Part 3: Chained Conditions
1. If-Elif-Else Statement Write an if-elif-else statement that prints “Excellent” if the score is 90 or above, “Good” if the score is between 70 and 89, “Pass” if the score is between 50 and 69, and “Fail” if the score is below 50.
``` _


```

``` _


```

## Part 4: Practice Problems

## Problem 1 Create a truth table for the following expression: ( (A \text{ AND } B) \text{ OR } (C \text{ AND } D) ). 
|  && | | | | | |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |      --- |
| A   | B   | C   | D   | (A && B) | (C && D) |
| true | true | true | true | | 
| true | true | true | false | | 
| true | false | true | true | |
| false | true | false | true | |
| false | false | false | false | |

## Problem 2 Write a block code function that takes a score as input and returns “Excellent”, “Good”, “Pass”, or “Fail” based on the score ranges provided in Part 3.
